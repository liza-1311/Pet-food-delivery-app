# Pet-food-delivery-application
The Pet Food Delivery Application is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The platform is designed to simplify the process of ordering food for pets, specifically catering to dog and cat owners. It provides a convenient, user-friendly, and responsive interface that allows pet owners to browse, select, and order food for their pets from the comfort of their homes.

The application offers a wide range of pet food products categorized by type of pet (dog or cat) as well as dietary preference—including vegetarian, non-vegetarian, and mixed (both) options. This categorization helps users quickly find the right type of food suitable for their pet’s needs and preferences.

Users can create an account by signing up with their name, Gmail address, and password. Once registered, they can log in to access the platform's full functionality. After logging in, users can view detailed product listings, add items to their cart, and proceed to place orders. The application is designed with a clean and responsive UI, ensuring a smooth user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

On the backend, Node.js and Express.js handle server-side operations, including user authentication, routing, and API management. The frontend is built with React.js, enabling a dynamic and seamless user experience. For data storage, the application uses a MongoDB Atlas cluster, which ensures scalable, reliable, and secure database management. All user data, product information, and order details are stored and managed in the cloud-based MongoDB database.

Overall, this project demonstrates practical implementation of a full-stack web application, showcasing CRUD operations, user authentication, product filtering, and responsive design. It serves as a great solution for pet owners looking for an easier way to feed their pets, while also being a solid portfolio piece to highlight full-stack development skills using the MERN stack.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
