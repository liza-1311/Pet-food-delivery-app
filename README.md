# Pet-food-delivery-application

The Pet Food Delivery Application is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The platform is designed to simplify the process of ordering food for pets, specifically catering to dog and cat owners. It provides a convenient, user-friendly, and responsive interface that allows pet owners to browse, select, and order food for their pets from the comfort of their homes.

The application offers a wide range of pet food products categorized by type of pet (dog or cat) as well as dietary preference—including vegetarian, non-vegetarian, and mixed (both) options. This categorization helps users quickly find the right type of food suitable for their pet’s needs and preferences.

Users can create an account by signing up with their name, Gmail address, and password. Once registered, they can log in to access the platform's full functionality. After logging in, users can view detailed product listings, add items to their cart, and proceed to place orders. The application is designed with a clean and responsive UI, ensuring a smooth user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

On the backend, Node.js and Express.js handle server-side operations, including user authentication, routing, and API management. The frontend is built with React.js, enabling a dynamic and seamless user experience. For data storage, the application uses a MongoDB Atlas cluster, which ensures scalable, reliable, and secure database management. All user data, product information, and order details are stored and managed in the cloud-based MongoDB database.

Overall, this project demonstrates practical implementation of a full-stack web application, showcasing CRUD operations, user authentication, product filtering, and responsive design. It serves as a great solution for pet owners looking for an easier way to feed their pets, while also being a solid portfolio piece to highlight full-stack development skills using the MERN stack.
